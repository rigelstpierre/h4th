              <p>Once again, it’s the time of year when we are preparing for our Heart for the House weekend. We wholeheartedly believe that we should always have more vision than resource, and our vision for the city of Toronto and beyond is huge! As Vantage Church, we are definitely seeing the fruit of many who have sown into the soil of our city before us and now we get to be a part of building strength for the future generations. What an amazing opportunity we have to make a way for others!
              <br />
              <br />
              2017 began with us declaring ‘BUILD' over our church and already we have seen God build strength in amazing ways! Our deepest desire for you personally, as we head into our Heart for the House Offering, is that you and your family will see God continue to build your lives and make a way for you as you make a way for others!

              <p>In previous years, this offering has helped us start our City Campus, bring on staff, and helped us open up our Hub space and we encourage you to be prayerfully considering the part that you can play on Sunday, June 11th for this year’s offering. Heart for the House has never been about equal giving, but it is marked by equal sacrifice. We know there is power in unity and together, with your contribution, we are believing to see our church go forwards from strength to strength and become all that she is called to be.
              <br />
              <br />
              We’re so expectant for what God is going to do through us collectively as a church in this season, but also personally in your life and in the lives of your family. We’re believing for miracles!
              <br />
              <br />
              We so love and appreciate you, church!
